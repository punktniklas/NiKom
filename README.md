NiKom is a bulletin board system (BBS) for AmigaOS that was originally developed by me (Niklas Lindholm) between 1990 and 1996. Then Tomas Kärki took over development for a few years until activity on the project died. In 2015 the source code of NiKom 1.60 was brought back into the world of the living and uploaded here by me. And so a new era of NiKom development began, now as an open source project.

General info about NiKom, the active BBS:es that are running it and donwloadable releases can be found at http://www.nikom.org/. The latest release can also be found at https://github.com/punktniklas/NiKom/releases/latest.

NiKom was originally entirely in Swedish but starting with v2.3.0 there is partial support for English. It follows the "KOM" model of command driven bulletin board system that was fairly popular in Sweden in the 90's.

I have used a clone of the hard drive contents of my old Amiga 3000 now running in FS-UAE (https://fs-uae.net/) to compile NiKom. It's running AmigaOS 3.1 and the C compiler is SAS/C 6.58.
